# üìë Note

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **No configuration sync**: The remotely-save plugin only syncs your vault files. It does not sync your plugin settings, UI preferences, themes, or workspace layout. You‚Äôll need to manually set those up on each device. 

> ‚úÖ **Custom configuration**: For custom configuration, fork this repository and maintain your own custom configuration. Then clone your custom vault repo on any new device, keeping your Obsidian experience consistent across platforms.
